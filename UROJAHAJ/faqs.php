                    Depending on the region of travel, each piece of checked baggage is restricted to a maximum
                    dimension
                    (length + width + height) of 158 cm for transatlantic flights, and 300 cm for all other
                    flights.<br><br>

                    If your TV fits within the dimensions and weight for the route being travelled, you may carry an
                    LED/LCD
                    TV as part of your checked-in luggage.<br><br>qatar

                    order
                    to withstand the effects of normal baggage handling procedures.
